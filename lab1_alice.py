Lab Due: 11:00am on Jan. 12

Objective:
0. Create a GitHub account and a repository named comp115 
(you can follow this guide: https://github.com/COMP115-Bravo/comp115/blob/main/Create%20a%20GitHub%20account%20and%20repository.pdf).
1. Practice how to run Python code in VScode or your IDE
2. Understand what is a comment, and what is a docstring in Python 
(this part is a docstring, which is a type of comments, providing info about modules, functions, classes, or methods)
3. Understand the concept of syntax error, semantic error, and runtime error
4. Understand how to use print() function in Python
5. Understand how to use a variable in Python
5. Understand how to use f-string in Python to involve variables in strings

#---------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 1 - Read the following code, try to guess the output, and run it to verify your guess.

# This exercise was inspired by one of our amazing friends in the class, who asked me how to use variables in programming.
#---------------------------------------------------------

x = 0
while x < 10:
    x = x + 2
    print(x)

#---------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 2 (40 marks) - Fix the semantic error below, to make it calculate the area of the rectangle correctly.
 
# A regular comment usually starts with a #. 
# Regular comments are used to explain parts of the code for developers reading it.
# So this part is a comment. # is only able to comment one line at a time.
# If you want to comment multiple lines, 
# you can use command + / (Mac) or ctl + / (Windows). 
# Or you can use ''' ''' or """ """ to create a multiline string or a docstring. 
#---------------------------------------------------------

print("There is a rectangle, of which one side is 3 and the other side is 4.") # This line prints a string.
side_1 = 3
side_2 = 4
print(f"I think the area of the rectangle is: {side_1 + side_2}.") # This line prints a f-string, including variables in a string.

Hi {my_instructor_name},

I am {my_name}. I like {my_hobby}.

My experience level in coding is {my_coding_experience}, at least I think.
I would love to learning coding {hours_coding_per_week} hours per week.
The projects I'd like to do in this term are: {project_interested} and {project_another_interested}.
Here is my GitHub account: {my_github_account}.

Hope we will have fun in learning Python together this term! 

Cheers,
{my_name}
