Lab 8 - DNA

Name: kulwinder kaur
Due Date: Mar. 15, 2023, 11am

This lab contains 3 small exercises in total. The objectives are:
1. Review how to utilize the different data types in different scenarios, such as dict, strings.
2. Review the accumulator algorithm pattern.
3. Learn about one of the DNA visualization method in bioinformatics, and how to break down a problem into subproblems.


Bioinformatics is a field where biologists use the power of computers
to help analyze biological data, such as DNA.

DNA can be represented as a long string of 4 characters: A, T, G, and C.

In this lab, we will create a graph of DNA using the Squiggleâ€™s visualization method.
In essence, a DNA sequence is first converted into binary using the 2bit encoding scheme
that maps 'T' to '00', 'C' to '01', 'A' to '10', and 'G' to '11',
e.g., 'ATGC' becomes: '10001101'

If you want to know more about Squiggle method, please refer to the following article:

Exercise 1 (40 marks)

Given a DNA sequence, return a coded sequence of 1's and 0's.
You will use the dna_to_code_dict to map between base and
the code, i.e.:

dna_to_code('A') returns '10'
dna_to_code('T') returns '00'
dna_to_code('G') returns '11'
dna_to_code('C') returns '01'
dna_to_code('AA') returns '1010'
dna_to_code('AATT') returns '10100000'

"""
Exercise 3 (30 marks)

With draw_coded written, we can create a DNA visualization
using the following sequence of commands:

code = dna_to_code('AGTTGC')
draw_coded(code, 'red')

To make it more convenient, complete the following
visualize() function by utilizing function dna_to_code() and draw_coded(),
such that we can pass in a DNA sequence
instead of a coded sequence, and our user will mainly 
interact with this visualize() function to visualize a DNA sequence.
